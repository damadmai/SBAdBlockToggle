This is a fork of SBAdBlockToggle 2.3.5.5.

Changes in 2.4.0:
- Initial fork
- Manual patching of ads built in to certain known applications has been removed
- Binary patching of applications known to have adblocker detection has been removed (this includes SBSettings itself; to get into the More Settings page, you must turn off the ad blocker)

Changes in 2.4.1:
- Added a few more common ad hosts to the block list

Note: Apps are getting smarter and are saving ads to use when the ad server can't be contacted. You may need to reinstall apps to remove their ads.

A packaged version of this project is available for manual installation from:
